# I.H-Challenge-2
Homework Challenge 2 assignment

Starting with a Header. Name on the left and on the right of the header have an About me, Work, Contact me, Resume.

I added a Header Image from google.

Made and About Me section with a Larger Picture and put a border around it.

I made 4 boxes on the right that shrink down to work with smaller screen and keep the website alligned.

The first two boxes also link you to a new webpage.

Added a footer.

I have not yet been able to link the taps to make the UI direct to the needed area. Running short on time and need to upload the project.
